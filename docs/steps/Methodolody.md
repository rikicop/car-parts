## Method

### 1. Identify the problem and divide it into its most basic parts

### 2. From those parts, identify the most important(visible) or the basic ones
I said visible because the most important part of a problem is the one that is visible to the user. 

### 3. Take the part you chose and try to solve it in isolation

### 4. Repeat the process until you have solved the problem

### 5. If you have solved the problem, you can now solve the problem as a whole and integrate it into the project or the state management in this case.

### 6. When you are working with state managment you most take into account the following:
- The state should be as simple as possible
- The state should be as predictable as possible
- The state should be as easy to test as possible
- Be clear where the state is coming from and where it is "going"
